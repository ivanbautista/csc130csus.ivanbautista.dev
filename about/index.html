  <div class="post-content">
    <h1 id="part-1-analysis-of-algorithms">Part 1: Analysis of Algorithms</h1>

<p>In this section, we will discuss how to analyze the performance of algorithms and compare the efficiency of different approaches to solving a problem.</p>

<h1 id="part-2-abstract-data-types">Part 2: Abstract Data Types</h1>

<p>An abstract data type (ADT) is a mathematical model for data types that defines the operations that can be performed on them and the behavior of those operations. In this section, we will learn about different ADTs and how to use them in practice.</p>

<h1 id="part-3-recursion">Part 3: Recursion</h1>

<p>Recursion is a method of solving problems in which a function calls itself with a simplified version of the original problem. In this section, we will learn about the different types of recursion and how to use recursion to solve problems.</p>

<h1 id="part-4-queues--stacks-in-practice">Part 4: Queues &amp; Stacks in Practice</h1>

<p>Queues and stacks are fundamental data structures that are used to store and retrieve data. In this section, we will learn about the different types of queues and stacks and how to use them in practice.</p>

<h1 id="part-5-binary-search--basic-sorting">Part 5: Binary Search &amp; Basic Sorting</h1>

<p>Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an element in a sorted list, and basic sorting algorithms are used to arrange elements in a specific order. In this section, we will learn about these algorithms and how to implement them.</p>

<h1 id="part-6-recursive-sorting-algorithms">Part 6: Recursive Sorting Algorithms</h1>

<p>Recursive sorting algorithms are a type of sorting algorithm that use recursion to sort a list of elements. In this section, we will learn about different recursive sorting algorithms and how to implement them.</p>

<h1 id="part-7-non-comparative-sorting">Part 7: Non-Comparative Sorting</h1>

<p>Non-comparative sorting algorithms are a type of sorting algorithm that do not rely on comparisons between elements to sort a list. In this section, we will learn about different non-comparative sorting algorithms and how to implement them.</p>

<h1 id="part-8-trees">Part 8: Trees</h1>

<p>A tree is a data structure that consists of nodes organized in a hierarchy. In this section, we will learn about different types of trees and how to use them in practice.</p>

<h1 id="part-9-heaps--priority-queues">Part 9: Heaps &amp; Priority Queues</h1>

<p>A heap is a complete binary tree in which the value of each node is greater than or equal to the values of its children, and a priority queue is a data structure that stores elements with associated priorities. In this section, we will learn about heaps and priority queues and how to use them in practice.</p>

<h1 id="part-10-binary-search-trees">Part 10: Binary Search Trees</h1>

<p>A binary search tree is a type of tree in which the value of each node is greater than the values of its left children and less than the values of its right children. In this section, we will learn about binary search trees and how to use them in practice.</p>

<h1 id="part-11-balanced-trees">Part 11: Balanced Trees</h1>

<p>A balanced tree is a tree in which the height of the left and right subtrees of every node differ by at most one. In this section, we will learn about different types of balanced trees and how to use them in practice.</p>

<h1 id="part-12-hashing">Part 12: Hashing</h1>

<p>Hashing is a method of storing and retrieving data in which a value (the “key”) is used to index into an array. In this section, we will learn about different types of hashing algorithms and how to use them in practice.</p>

<h1 id="part-13-graphs">Part 13: Graphs</h1>

<p>A graph is a data structure that consists of vertices (or “nodes”) connected by edges. In this section, we will learn about different types of graphs and how to use them in practice.</p>
